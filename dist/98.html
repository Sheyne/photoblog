    <h2>Yellow bike club!</h2>
<p>Andy, Carolyn, and company visited us from portland! Yesterday we went on a fun ebike food tour on a bright sunny day around my neighborhood and today we went mountain biking in the pouring rain. </p>
<p>Mattie would like the blog to know that biking in the rain gave her a cold and she basically has pneumonia now. Don't worry she has slight sniffles.</p>
